    <h1>My Role Model</h1>
    <p class="text">As a young child, I learned many life
        lessons from my father. He seemed a best role model for me in the world. He was the one who taught
        me what is right and what is wrong, and certainly he was also the only person who could understand
        me and be supportive in difficulties. He actually does not care about my future plans but he gives me
        freedom to try new things. He is kind and very benevolent by nature.
    </p>
    <h1>Changes in my Life</h1>
    <p class="text">
        After two or three years passed, I began to show some minor but satisfying results in my study.
        However I still had interest in technology. In my English course also, whenever a free topic was given,
        I was the one who wrote only about robots or some kind of AI. Whenever I was free from reading or
        household jobs, I would be busy with creating something new, something interesting.
        Our life is very simple but joyful. Family is united and respectful to each other, especially my
        brother is the person I and my sister can call a second mother. The reason for our happiness may be
        the climate in the house and certainly characters of my parents who came to agreement in many
        situations. There used to be sometimes quarrels between them but then they again solved those
        quarrels in fair ways. As long as I remember, we never had problems with money until my dad stopped
        his job. It was after 2016, family faced failure after failure. Brother did not approve of public
        universities, thus did not apply to any of them. Sister tried very hard, she did all she was able to do,
        anyway could not get accepted two years. It is so vivid in my memory now that sister preferred getting
        education in downtown. Therefore father provided her with all the necessary things and tried to make
        meet her needs in education. After mother saw what happened with her, she decided to marry her to
        the one who had already been close friends with sister because anyways sister was wasting time,
        money and importantly loosening family relationships. To tell the truth, sister never had curiosity to
        education. Besides environment also plays the biggest role in a person’s development. She was in a
        place where people are unfair and only work for their own benefit. Actually, it is true that it depends on
        the person himself to make his own decisions and endeavor to achieve what he wants but as the coin
        has two sides, there are some factors that affect us in negative ways and kick in the legs.
        Finally, turn had come to me. My sister always wanted me to get educated in whatever ways
        possible. It was she who introduced me the world of science and clever people. First, I resisted going
        to the city and study there. Mentioning the fact that our country has well-designed education system
        only in cities and outskirts are focused on mostly industry and agriculture. I was at the age of 16 when
        I came to the downtown. It was totally a new world for me. I saw people absolutely different from our
        villagers. They are already ahead of us in many things. Climate was much noisier and busier than I
        expected. It seemed like a wonderland for me though it was a simple city, simpler than other major
        regions in the country. I had never seen such a road filled with different means of transport. In my
        opinion, people in the city have much prestige, wealth and decent job but I was wrong. They are
        similar with people in other parts of the state in all ways.
        My sister and I wandered around because we did not know where to go first and did not have any
        place to stay even though we both knew why were there. We looked at each other strangely with the
        hope that one of us would give some kind of opinion about what to start first. Then my sister started
        her speech saying : we will look for an education center for you and visit our aunt. I was so naive at
        the moment because I was raised in a family where many things were restricted or limited. My outlook
        was very narrow and filled with only ideas that were nonsense or meaningless. We found the center
        we were searching and got into a reception. I was in deep stress mixed with nervous feeling. That was
        a good experience, though. The receptionist asked me some questions, I was able to respond to them
        all. After an enjoyable conversation, we visited aunt, Sarah not common name in our nation. She
        welcomed us warmly and organized a special dinner in the evening. It was that time where a new
        phase kicked off in my life. I felt a bit uncomfortable there since it was the second time coming to their
        apartment. She has four children whom I cannot remember well as we had seen each other only twice
        or three times. Our relationship was not that good on my mother’s side. I spent most of my time with
        cousins on my father’s side. It did not take much time to get along well with aunt’s youngest son. He
        was the only left at home since his two brothers already found their own way and sister got married.
        The first month was difficult for me. New school environment was not the same as in my old
        school. Everything changed dramatically. I had a hardship of getting accustomed to new school
        teachers and classmates. Day by day, I made new friends and showed myself at school. The following
        year came depressing for me, though. Sister left me in the city. Dangerous worries appeared and did
        not give peace to my heart. Thoughts came to my mind : what if you cannot achieve anything, what if
        you just give up study, enjoy your life with your friends instead. My results in the education center and
        at school dropped palpably. I was spending so much money on stupid lifestyle that if I look at the past
        now, I say to myself these words: you were such an evil and ungrateful human being.
        Summer holiday arrived. Time came to work, help parents and at the same time revise what I
        acquired during study period. Mother welcomed me with a big smile and hug. She was not aware of
        the fact that my life got messed up. I tried to keep all the things happened in downtown as a secret.
        That summer seemed relaxing but last days passed with worry that I would again go back to the life
        which had affected me in a more negative way than in a positive one. Of course, there was a minor
        result on me but during nine months of study, I should have learned many things. Three months were
        like three days. I tried to spend those valuable months with my father learning new moral and
        beneficial lessons. My father is a religious person, so every word of his is truth for me, and no matter
        how difficult to stand in front of him when he becomes angry, I would be tolerant. Whenever pains
        came up in life, I would take advice from him all the time.
        Time has arrived to come back to the city and study. I was in the ninth form at school. In the
        beginning, I did want to go to school any longer but then I looked at the consequences that may
        appear after I stop attending school. New term has started for all the students most of whose goals are
        not set yet and will just wander around for the upcoming three terms. I decided to make that year the
        one that I would complete many tasks and come up with a considerable result in the end. So, my old
        English education center was waiting for me because I did not want to attend to any other courses for I
        was not the person who can settle down with a new climate easily. Things went on in an opposite way,
        I wished many good omens to happen. People in the city appeared to have become worse while my
        absence. It was the same atmosphere, the same school but people were different. Again one year
        was wasted doing nothing, instead, hearing more bad tidings and facing more hardships than in the
        previous year. Of course, there were my best friends and fellas whom I could count on and spend our
        time efficiently. Friends in need are friends indeed, this phrase is engraved in my memory, and they
        did not embarrass me in many conditions though our opinions were usually opposite or totally
        different.
        When I was in the tenth form, I started to look at things seriously. As a curious student, I tried
        everything such as history, geography, biology and even math, finally ended up in English because it
        was the only way out to apply for foreign universities and get somewhat freedom from traditional life.
        I stood out as a leader among my classmates but actually, it was all publicity stunt. What I was
        worrying about was that my fellas had already found their own way, some of them had already been
        making money and helping parents. A thought came to my mind “ why don’t you amaze them with
        your knowledge? Besides your parents hope that one day you will become a person who can change
        the world into a better place.” On that day, I took a journey to find the best education center in the city.
        I had heard much about one which many people praised and where many brainy guys came out and
        some were already studying abroad. In a time of mass media, when everyone was getting confused
        with false news, it was difficult to believe what is true and wrong. However, if a person stays firm in his
        goals, it becomes easy to try and make some surprising results. After coming up with many wrong
        addresses, I found the place I had been looking for since morning. At that moment, one thing struck
        my mind : I felt quite grown-up because for the first time, I was doing jobs on my own. By the
        appearance, it didn’t look like a place where students learn a language. It was like a building with
        posters of job vacancies in dressmaking and mending household items. After a while, guys trying to
        communicate with each other in English were coming out of the building. Environment was really
        different and exciting. It really blew my mind. All the positive-thinking people were right in front of me,
        giving hope to go ahead and never turn back. On the spot, I rushed into the building and asked the
        exam dates of the new course term. Interestingly, even if you are new to the center, you have to take
        an inside exam held once in three months.
        From the moment I began attending that English course, my view of the world noticeably changed
        into a positive side. Being among people who can set clear goals and think about ways to make them
        come true helped me to realize most of the things necessary in life. It wasn’t just a place to teach
        English, it was a place to teach the main purpose of life too. As long as I can remember, I got the best
        quote from one of my best teachers there, saying “ there are two reasons why humans are created.
        First is that the creator wants us to flourish the Earth with our brain and second is that he wants us to
        worship him only.” He added “ We are the ones that make the world look as it is.” That was true
        because animals or plants can’t do anything but eating and sleeping. Teachers are real role models
        for students and students put respect towards teachers on top there. The first and second levels did
        not appear that much challenging and on those levels I devoted myself to the new language so much
        that I could not spend time with my friends or even sometimes family members.
        Days and moths passed like quick-flowing water in a fall. It was winter time and somewhat depressing
        time of the season for me. It was my third-level period, and I did not like it. I confronted many
        hardships of the level, especially grammar part seemed too obscure. It was as if the world was turning
        its back on me. Of course there is ease after every hardship, and I did not lose my hope. Instead, I
        followed every single word of my teacher. At the beginning of the level, I clearly remember, our
        teacher told us to think about what we had done and what we achieved till that time. Especially his
        next tip is coming in handy in my current life, it was about setting clear goals for future and working on
        it day and night. How much I tried in that level, all was spoiled, I failed. Never ever expected failure in
        my childhood. How lazy and snobbish was I. On that day, I realized the main purpose of life. It doesn't
        only consist of only studying but rather being creative and curious in every area. To get rid of
        depression and sadness, I tried to think about what I call the futuristic world of 2150, the world of
        robots and unimaginable technology. Can you think of a new life with robots present in your house,
        doing all the jobs even the ones human beings cannot do? Can you imagine flying cars that can take
        you to your destination in few minutes? In addition, I am going to create a climate in which there will
        be more trees adding more beauty and oxygen to the world in 2150. Why not possible? asked myself.
        Continuing the dream, I imagined the people in my futuristic world, who will be much more cultural and
        clever. I will try to bring those people together and make them stand together to make the world the
        best house for every living creatures. Education and medicine will be on top, helping people to live a
        prosperous life. I felt great relief after that. 'It is high time to try harder and overcome whatever
        difficulties will come up' firmly told myself. Today, the whole world is changing and life is like a forest,
        only predators can survive and have the ability to build up their own empire. And the animals which
        are weak are the ones which end up being preys for the clever and strong.
        Winter gave its turn to spring. The season which was full of success and happiness. Long-waited
        hope and luck came back and I was able to do my best in not only English but also in other subjects in
        my school. My father used to tell my in childhood : if your belief is pure and strong, if you love what
        you do, then you are the one going on the right path. He always wanted me to keep one thing in mind:
        gain experience in every field everywhere and never lose your hope that will take you to the position
        you deserve. That spring was full of blessings and I could use them all. I kept on with fast pace for the
        rest of the year. Finally, after nearly one year of being in a beautiful language environment, I took a
        certificate which qualifies a degree in English.
        Today, I work for the same education center. With positivity and hope, I am currently trying to
        applying for one of the top-ranking universities in America. Afterwards, I am going to start designing
        what I call “The futuristic world of 2150”. Today, I know that education is the only way to make us
        human beings, wise creatures of the earth.</p>
