            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="text">
                The weather in a small village is mostly cloudy and partially sunny. Streets are quiet almost all day.
                Our house is in a perfect position. There is a small stream flowing next to our house. We have a small
                attic at home, in which old equipment and other bric-a-bric are kept. Once my dad and I were sorting
                out things there, an antique clock captured my attention. I was very curious about the technology and
                robotics. The clock was a suitable item to do experiment on. Though I did not have much information
                and knowledge about technology, I started to make small and simple robots at home. My outlook
                began widening with that. Most of my time used to be spent on creating some kind of futuristic toy cars
                that my parents would punish me all the time. “What is the matter with most parents? They don’t give
                freedom to their children. What they usually say is ‘do that, do this’. Why don’t you just create a
                little
                bit comfortable atmosphere for your son and he will prove he is able to do many things on his own”
                thoughts like these filled my mind.

        <h1>Destroyer or Builder?</h1>
        <p class="text">Things I made were mostly made of materials like plastic and
            aluminum. For building that kind of things, old items like a TV or a vacuum cleaner at home would be
            used. One day I reached the point that the model of a helicopter that I made from a Coke can started
            to fly without facing a failure. I expected my mother to tell something good or at least become proud of
            me but my happiness turned into sadness. She punished me for wasting time and told me to do my
            best at school instead. At that time school subjects could not really interest me. Besides I would not
            tolerate my teachers’ harassment. Most of them discouraged me and treated me like a student who
            can’t achieve anything in life. Of course, many students already surpassed me in terms of many fields
            but what they were doing was for their own benefit and what I was doing was for my own.
            After receiving many reprimands from my parents, I realized that maybe I really have to concern
            about my study and think about future. We were three children in the family but I was the only one
            whom my parents counted on and believed that I would be a great and knowledgeable person. Our life
            was not so bad but my mother always thought about my future.</p>
